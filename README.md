This project is a Hospital Management System developed in the CME 2210 Object-Oriented Analysis and Design course at [Computer Engineering Department of Dokuz Eylül University](https://ceng.deu.edu.tr/en/). 
The system aims to improve medication management, optimize patient care, and increase hospital efficiency. 
It has the capability to track patients, medical treatment orders, and staff members.

## Technologies Used
Object-oriented programming principles<br>
Java programming language <br>
JavaFX library for the graphical user interface <br>

2- Open the project in your preferred Java IDE. <br>
3- Build and run the project. <br>
4- Extract the contents of requiredlibs.zip into a folder. <br>
5- Set the JavaFX SDK version 18.0.2 as the module path in your IDE or build system. <br>
6- Add all the extracted libraries from requiredlibs.zip to your project's dependencies. <br>
7- Use the login screen to enter the system with valid credentials. <br>
8- Navigate through the different panels according to your user role (e.g., Manager, Doctor, Nurse, Pharmacist, Receptionist). <br> <br>
  
  If you encounter any issues related to JavaFX dependencies, make sure to add the following VM arguments in your IDE:<br>
